# Overview of functions

As part of the GeoLink project, we have created a series of R
functions to make it easier to work with spatial data in your
R workflows. 

Functions are designed for each major platform that hosts
spatial data at NINA. Those platforms are the R:\GeoSpatialData
folder, GRASS, the PostGIS database, and S3 buckets.

Note that some platforms will have functions for both
reading and writing data on the platform. Others are read only.

It is not possible to write data onto the R:\GeoSpatialData
folder or the PostGIS database. You can write data to a 
GRASS mapset or to an S3 bucket.

Individual pages will describe the functions in more detail.
