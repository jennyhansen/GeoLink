# ☁️ Introduction to S3 Storage at NINA

NINA is beginning to implement the **S3 storage protocol** as a modern and flexible way to store spatial data, project outputs, and large datasets that do not fit well into traditional file-folder structures. S3 (short for *Simple Storage Service*) is widely used in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the
primary cloud provider of S3, but NINA is using a local provider instead. The base URL of NINAs
S3 buckets is `s3-int-1.nina.no`

Because S3 is new to many NINA employees, this page provides a gentle, user-friendly introduction to what it is, how it works, and why it is becoming an important part of our data infrastructure.

# What is S3?

S3 is not a typical file system with folders and subfolders. Instead, it is a **storage platform for objects**, where each object is a file stored inside a container called a **bucket**.  

Think of it like this:

- A **bucket** is similar to a project folder.
- An **object** is a file stored inside the bucket.
- An **object key** is the file’s “path” inside the bucket (e.g., `admin/grids/ssb_250m.parquet`).

S3 is built for:

- fast access to large datasets  
- reliable and redundant storage  
- sharing data without duplicating it  
- flexible integration with analysis tools like R and Python  

NINA’s S3 system is hosted internally, so data always stays within NINA’s network.

# Buckets vs. Folders vs. Files

S3 uses slightly different terminology than a normal file system.

| Concept | Traditional File System | S3 Equivalent |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Top-level container | Drive or Shared Folder | **Bucket** |
| Directory | Folder | *Prefix* (simulated folder) |
| File | File | **Object** |
| Filepath | Path | **Object key** |

Even though S3 does not have real folders, tools like the AWS console, NinaR, and GeoLink display buckets *as if* they contain folders. This makes S3 feel familiar even though the underlying structure is different.

# Why is NINA adopting S3?

S3 offers several advantages over traditional shared drives:

### **1. Handles large and complex file formats**
Ideal for:
- multi-band rasters  
- very large vector datasets  
- spatial databases exported as Parquet or GeoPackage  
- high-resolution model predictions  

### **2. Better for sharing data across projects**
One central dataset can be accessed by many people without copying it.

### **3. Supports modern geospatial formats**
Formats like:
- **GeoParquet**  
- Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (**COG**)  are designed specifically for S3-style object storage.

### **4. Works well with R and Python**
The GeoLink package provides easy functions in R for:
- listing buckets  
- reading data directly from S3  
- writing project outputs to buckets  

Future work can include developing similar functions for Python.

### **5. Integrates with automation**
Great for workflows where models or scripts generate outputs automatically on servers.

Where is NINA’s S3 located?

NINA’s S3 system is hosted **internally**, through a MinIO-based S3-compatible service.

Internal endpoint:

```
s3-int-1.nina.no
```

This is not an external cloud service — it runs entirely inside NINA’s network.

You can access S3 only from:

- the **GIS server**
- **RStudio servers** (rstudio.nina.no or rstudio-geo.nina.no)
- or a NINA computer connected via VPN

This ensures data security and compliance.

As part of the GeoLink project, we have developed several functions for working
with geospatial data on S3 buckets. You can read the documentation at 
**Functions → S3 functions**. You can also learn to work with the S3 protocol
using the **S3 vignette** located under **Vignettes → S3Vignette**.
