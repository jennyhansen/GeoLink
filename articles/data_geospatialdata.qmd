# üó∫Ô∏è GeoSpatialData on the R Drive

The `GeoSpatialData` folder on the R: drive is a centralized collection
of raster, vector, and gridded spatial datasets used in many of NINA‚Äôs
GIS workflows. It includes base layers such as:

-   Land cover and vegetation maps
-   Elevation models (DEM)
-   Hydrology and slope layers
-   Municipality boundaries and grids (e.g., SSB grids)
-   Gridded climate data


There is a data inventory Excel spreadsheet at
`R:\GeoSpatialData\Data\_Inventory.xlsx` where you can find the most current 
overview of the data available on the R drive. Data is generally grouped into broad
categories such as AdministrativeUnits, Elevation, Hydrography,
Landcover, StatisticalUnits, Topography, etc.

Within each subfolder of a category, you can expect to see five
subfolders:

1.  Converted
2.  Original
3.  Processed
4.  Scripts
5.  Shared

Original (raw) data is in the Original subfolder and is what most people
generally work with. The Converted subfolder is usually empty, but some
may contain data, e.g. Norway_AdministrativeUnits in
AdministrativeUnits. Many of the datasets will have files in the
Processed folder. This may include data converted from one type to
another, data clipped or subset to a specific region, changes in
projections (CRS), etc. The Scripts subfolder will contain the relevant
scripts used to process or convert data, e.g. from SOSI to shp. The
purpose of the Shared subfolder is unknown.

GeoLink contains a pair of helper functions to find and import data from
the GeoSpatialData folder on the R drive. Note that these only work when
working from the \[NINA RStudio server\] (https://rstudio.nina.no) or the GIS
server (accessed through Omnissa Horizon Client.
