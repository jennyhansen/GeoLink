# 🗺️ GeoSpatialData on the R Drive

The `GeoSpatialData` folder on the R: drive is a centralized collection
of raster, vector, and gridded spatial datasets used in many of NINA’s
GIS and modeling workflows. It contains a wide range of core reference
layers, including:

- Land cover and vegetation maps  
- Elevation models (DEM)  
- Hydrology, slope, and terrain derivatives  
- Administrative boundaries and reference grids (e.g., SSB grids)  
- Gridded climate data (e.g., seNorge)  

Whenever possible, it is recommended to use these shared datasets
directly rather than downloading separate copies into local or project
folders. Working from the shared R-drive structure reduces duplication
and places less load on NINA’s data infrastructure.

## Major categories of data

Spatial data on the R drive is organized into thematic categories.
Some contain only a few datasets, while others include many versions or
collections. The current top-level categories are:

- AdministrativeUnits  
- Adresses  
- Agriculture_aquaculture  
- AreaManagement_ReportingUnits  
- BiogeographicalRegions  
- Buildings  
- CadastralParcels  
- Downloaded  
- Elevation  
- Environmental_Monitoring_Facilities  
- GeographicalNames  
- Geology  
- Geomorphology  
- grasscourse  
- Habitats_biotopes  
- Hydrography  
- LandCover  
- LandUse  
- Meteorology  
- NaturalRiskZones  
- Orthoimagery  
- Population_demography  
- ProtectedSites  
- SeaRegions  
- Soil  
- StatisticalUnits  
- Topography  
- TransportNetworks  
- Utility_governmentalServices  

An evolving data inventory spreadsheet is available for download:  
[➡️ Download dataset overview (Excel)](data/spatial_data_inventory.xlsx)

This inventory provides a high-level overview of datasets available on
various NINA platforms, including the GeoSpatialData folder. It is
non-exhaustive and mainly covers national-scale datasets used in species
distribution modeling, ecosystem accounting, and area planning.

## Subfolders

Navigating the data structure can be challenging. Within each category,
multiple subfolders may exist, often representing different versions,
time periods, or data sources. Most dataset folders follow a common
internal structure:

1. **Converted**  
2. **Original**  
3. **Processed**  
4. **Scripts**  
5. **Shared**

**Original** contains the raw, unmodified data exactly as downloaded from
the source. This is typically what most users work with.

**Converted** may contain alternative formats (e.g., shapefiles or file
geodatabases) when the original dataset was in a different format such as
SOSI. Not all datasets have content in the Converted folder, but some do.

**Processed** is more common and often includes clipped versions,
projection changes, subsets for specific regions, or conversions to
standardized NINA formats.

**Scripts** contains the scripts used to convert or process datasets
(e.g., SOSI → SHP conversion, building virtual rasters, or other
preprocessing steps).

**Shared** folders are generally empty; their intended purpose is unknown.

## Working with data in the GeoSpatialData folder

You can only access the GeoSpatialData folder from a NINA computer,
either directly from a NINA office or remotely using AlwaysOnVPN. The
folder is also available when working on one of the Linux servers
(e.g., through **Mounts → R → GeoSpatialData**).

Note that GeoSpatialData is **read-only**. You can import data from it,
but you cannot modify or write to it. Any derived or processed data
should be written to a local directory or a project folder.

GeoLink includes two helper functions for listing and importing datasets
from the GeoSpatialData folder. More information about these functions can
be found under **Functions → R:GeoSpatialData**. You can also work
through the **GeoSpatialData vignette** located under **Vignettes →
GeoSpatialData** for a step-by-step guide on using GeoLink with R-drive
data.
