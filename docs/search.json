Those platforms are the R: folder, GRASS, the PostGIS database, and S3 buckets.\nNote that some platforms will have functions for both reading and writing data on the platform. Others are read only.\nIt is not possible to write data onto the R: folder or the PostGIS database. You can write data to a GRASS mapset or to an S3 bucket.\nIndividual pages will describe the functions in more detail."

    "text": "🗺️ GeoSpatialData on the R Drive\nThe GeoSpatialData folder on the R: drive is a centralized collection of raster, vector, and gridded spatial datasets used in many of NINA’s GIS workflows. It includes base layers such as:\n\nLand cover and vegetation maps\nElevation models (DEM)\nHydrology and slope layers\nMunicipality boundaries and grids (e.g., SSB grids)\nGridded climate data\n\nThere is a data inventory Excel spreadsheet at R:\\GeoSpatialData\\Data\\_Inventory.xlsx where you can find the most current overview of the data available on the R drive. Data is generally grouped into broad categories such as AdministrativeUnits, Elevation, Hydrography, Landcover, StatisticalUnits, Topography, etc.\nWithin each subfolder of a category, you can expect to see five subfolders:\n\nConverted\nOriginal\nProcessed\nScripts\nShared\n\nOriginal (raw) data is in the Original subfolder and is what most people generally work with. The Converted subfolder is usually empty, but some may contain data, e.g. Norway_AdministrativeUnits in AdministrativeUnits. Many of the datasets will have files in the Processed folder. This may include data converted from one type to another, data clipped or subset to a specific region, changes in projections (CRS), etc. The Scripts subfolder will contain the relevant scripts used to process or convert data, e.g. from SOSI to shp. The purpose of the Shared subfolder is unknown.\nGeoLink contains a pair of helper functions to find and import data from the GeoSpatialData folder on the R drive. Note that these only work when working from the [NINA RStudio server] (https://rstudio.nina.no) or the GIS server (accessed through Omnissa Horizon Client.\n\n\nGeoLink functions for R:"

    "text": "GeoLink is a new initiative at NINA designed to make it easier for researchers and engineers to access, understand, and use the organisation’s geospatial data. Over decades, NINA has accumulated extensive datasets on species, climate, land use, ecosystems, and human activity—resources that are central to our research and activities. However, much of this data is scattered across different repositories, poorly catalogued, and often difficult for non-experts to import into their workflows. As a result, NINA employees spend too much time searching for, re-downloading, or re-processing data that already exists. GeoLink aims to reduce these barriers by creating a shared overview of environmental geospatial datasets and developing practical tools that make the data easy to find and use.\nThe project focuses on two main areas: improving data visibility and building user-friendly tools. First, GeoLink will compile an updated, researcher-driven inventory of the most relevant geospatial datasets hosted at NINA. This will be prioritized for national-scale environmental data frequently used in ecological modelling and land-use planning. In parallel, will be the development of functions that allow users to import “analysis-ready” geospatial data directly into their workflow without needing advanced technical skills. This includes exploring storage solutions, ensuring interoperability, and laying the groundwork for long-term alignment with Miljødata.\nBy improving access to shared data, GeoLink supports more efficient research, reduces duplicated effort, and strengthens collaboration across departments. Easier access to geospatial resources will help new staff get up to speed faster, lower the technical threshold for working with spatial data, and reduce pressure on NINA’s IT infrastructure. Ultimately, the project will provide a strategy for accessing and working with geospatial data as our organization continues to grow.\nUse the navigation bar on the top to view the various data sources and explore functions and how-to vignettes."
