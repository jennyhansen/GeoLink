This region is independent of any individual dataset; instead, it is a user-controlled setting that governs how analyses align input layers and produce output. GRASS automatically resamples or aligns inputs to this region, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.\nYou can set the region using an existing raster or vector:\nexecGRASS(\"g.region\", parameters = list(raster = \"my_raster\", res = 100))\nexecGRASS(\"g.region\", parameters = list(vector = \"my_vector\"))\nOr you can define the region manually. For example, this bounding box covers part of the Oslofjord area in EPSG:25833 with 10 m resolution:\nexecGRASS(\n  \"g.region\",\n  parameters = list(n = 6640000, s = 6575000, e = 610000, w = 520000, res = 10)\n)\nAny raster operation you perform will be constrained to this region.\n\nMasks\nGRASS also uses an optional mask, which restricts raster calculations to a defined area. Any cells outside the mask become NULL, even if underlying data exists there. This allows you to focus analyses on specific boundaries or study areas without physically clipping datasets.\nCreate a mask from a raster:\nexecGRASS(\"r.mask\", parameters = list(raster = \"mask_raster\"))\nOr from a vector:\nexecGRASS(\"r.mask\", parameters = list(vector = \"mask_vector\"))\nRemove the mask:\nexecGRASS(\"r.mask\", flags = \"r\")"

Instead of remembering which R package or function to use for each file type, this function automatically chooses the correct tool based on the file extension.\nYou can provide either: - a relative path from /data/R/GeoSpatialData, or\n- a full absolute path to a file or directory.\nThe function then determines the file type and loads it using the appropriate approach:\n\nVector formats\nHandled via sf: - Shapefiles (.shp) - GeoJSON files (.geojson) - GeoPackage files (.gpkg) – requires specifying a layer name\n- File Geodatabases (.gdb) – requires specifying a layer name\n- GeoParquet files (.parquet) (using sfarrow)\n\n\nRaster formats\nHandled via terra: - GeoTIFF (.tif, .tiff) - IMG, ASC, VRT - NetCDF (.nc) - Other raster formats supported by terra\nFor multi-layer file types (GPKG, GDB), you must supply a layer argument so the function knows which dataset inside the container to load. If you are unsure which layers are available, you can inspect them with:\nsf::st_layers(path_to_file)\nimport_from_rgsd() returns:\n\nan sf object when reading vector data\n\na SpatRaster when reading raster data\n\nThis function is helpful when:\n\nworking with multiple formats across a project\n\nstandardizing data access in shared scripts or pipelines\n\navoiding mistakes caused by mixing terra and sf usage\n\nloading datasets from deeply nested directories\n\nwriting reproducible code that does not depend on the working directory\n\nTogether, list_from_rgsd() and import_from_rgsd() streamline access to NINA’s shared spatial datasets and reduce the friction of navigating a large, diverse data archive."

    "text": "☁️ Introduction to S3 Storage at NINA\nNINA is beginning to implement the S3 storage protocol as a modern and flexible way to store spatial data, project outputs, and large datasets that do not fit well into traditional file-folder structures. S3 (short for Simple Storage Service) is widely used in cloud computing, but it can also be run on local servers—like NINA’s internal S3 environment. This means we get cloud-like data storage without sending any data outside NINA.\nBecause S3 is new to many NINA employees, this page provides a gentle, user-friendly introduction to what it is, how it works, and why it is becoming an important part of our data infrastructure.\n\n\n\nWhat is S3?\nS3 is not a typical file system with folders and subfolders. Instead, it is a storage platform for objects, where each object is a file stored inside a container called a bucket.\nThink of it like this:\n\nA bucket is similar to a project folder.\nAn object is a file stored inside the bucket.\nAn object key is the file’s “path” inside the bucket (e.g., admin/grids/ssb_250m.parquet).\n\nS3 is built for:\n\nfast access to large datasets\n\nreliable and redundant storage\n\nsharing data without duplicating it\n\nflexible integration with analysis tools like R and Python\n\nNINA’s S3 system is hosted internally, so data always stays within NINA’s network.\n\n\n\nBuckets vs. Folders vs. Files\nS3 uses slightly different terminology than a normal file system.\n\n\n\nConcept\nTraditional File System\nS3 Equivalent\n\n\n\n\nTop-level container\nDrive or Shared Folder\nBucket\n\n\nDirectory\nFolder\nPrefix (simulated folder)\n\n\nFile\nFile\nObject\n\n\nFilepath\nPath\nObject key\n\n\n\nEven though S3 does not have real folders, tools like the AWS console, NinaR, and GeoLink display buckets as if they contain folders. This makes S3 feel familiar even though the underlying structure is different.\n\n\n\nWhy is NINA adopting S3?\nS3 offers several advantages over traditional shared drives:\n\n1. Handles large and complex file formats\nIdeal for: - multi-band rasters\n- very large vector datasets\n- spatial databases exported as Parquet or GeoPackage\n- high-resolution model predictions\n\n\n2. Better for sharing data across projects\nOne central dataset can be accessed by many people without copying it.\n\n\n3. Supports modern geospatial formats\nFormats like: - GeoParquet\n- Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) are designed specifically for S3-style object storage.\n\n\n4. Works well with R and Python\nThe GeoLink package provides easy functions in R for: - listing buckets\n- reading data directly from S3\n- writing project outputs to buckets\nFuture work can include developing similar functions for Python.\n\n\n5. Integrates with automation\nGreat for workflows where models or scripts generate outputs automatically on servers.\n\nWhere is NINA’s S3 located?\nNINA’s S3 system is hosted internally, through a MinIO-based S3-compatible service.\nInternal endpoint:\ns3-int-1.nina.no\nThis is not an external cloud service — it runs entirely inside NINA’s network.\nYou can access S3 only from:\n\nthe GIS server\nRStudio servers (rstudio.nina.no or rstudio-geo.nina.no)\nor a NINA computer connected via VPN\n\nThis ensures data security and compliance.\nAs part of the GeoLink project, we have developed several functions for working with geospatial data on S3 buckets. You can read the documentation at Functions → S3 functions. You can also learn to work with the S3 protocol using the S3 vignette located under Vignettes → S3Vignette."

    "text": "GeoLink is a new initiative at NINA designed to make it easier for researchers and engineers to access, understand, and use the organisation’s geospatial data. Over decades, NINA has accumulated extensive datasets on species, climate, land use, ecosystems, and human activity—resources that are central to our research and activities. However, much of this data is scattered across different repositories, poorly catalogued, and often difficult for non-experts to import into their workflows. As a result, NINA employees spend too much time searching for, re-downloading, or re-processing data that already exists. GeoLink aims to reduce these barriers by creating a shared overview of environmental geospatial datasets and developing practical tools that make the data easy to find and use.\nThe project focuses on two main areas: improving data visibility and building user-friendly tools. First, GeoLink will compile an updated, researcher-driven inventory of the most relevant geospatial datasets hosted at NINA. This will be prioritized for national-scale environmental data frequently used in ecological modelling and land-use planning. In parallel, will be the development of functions that allow users to import “analysis-ready” geospatial data directly into their workflow without needing advanced technical skills. This includes exploring storage solutions, ensuring interoperability, and laying the groundwork for long-term alignment with Miljødata.\nBy improving access to shared data, GeoLink supports more efficient research, reduces duplicated effort, and strengthens collaboration across departments. Easier access to geospatial resources will help new staff get up to speed faster, lower the technical threshold for working with spatial data, and reduce pressure on NINA’s IT infrastructure. Ultimately, the project will provide a strategy for accessing and working with geospatial data as our organization continues to grow.\nUse the navigation bar on the top to view the various data sources and explore functions and how-to vignettes."
