It includes base layers such as:\n\nLand cover and vegetation maps\nElevation models (DEM)\nHydrology and slope layers\nMunicipality boundaries and grids (e.g., SSB grids)\nGridded climate data\n\nThere is a data inventory Excel spreadsheet at R:\\GeoSpatialData\\Data\\_Inventory.xlsx where you can find the most current overview of the data available on the R drive. Data is generally grouped into broad categories such as AdministrativeUnits, Elevation, Hydrography, Landcover, StatisticalUnits, Topography, etc.\nWithin each subfolder of a category, you can expect to see five subfolders:\n\nConverted\nOriginal\nProcessed\nScripts\nShared\n\nOriginal (raw) data is in the Original subfolder and is what most people generally work with. The Converted subfolder is usually empty, but some may contain data, e.g.¬†Norway_AdministrativeUnits in AdministrativeUnits. Many of the datasets will have files in the Processed folder. This may include data converted from one type to another, data clipped or subset to a specific region, changes in projections (CRS), etc. The Scripts subfolder will contain the relevant scripts used to process or convert data, e.g.¬†from SOSI to shp. The purpose of the Shared subfolder is unknown.\nGeoLink contains a pair of helper functions to find and import data from the GeoSpatialData folder on the R drive. Note that these only work when working from the [NINA RStudio server] (https://rstudio.nina.no).\n\n\nGeoLink functions for R:"
